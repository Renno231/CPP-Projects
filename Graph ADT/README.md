# Welcome to the Graph ADT repository!

This repository is dedicated to the Graph ADT project, which was created as part of a Data Structures class. With many hours of hard work and determination, the project was successfully completed and includes a feature for calculating the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstras Algorithm. To verify the functionality of the class, a comprehensive set of tests have been included.
